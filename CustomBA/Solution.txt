The problem is caused by the burn engine not beeing signed.To fix this you just need to perform the following steps after building the bootstrapper package.

    detach the engine from YourInstaller:
    insignia -ib "YourInstaller.exe" -o engine.exe
    sign engine.exe with your certificate
    re-attach the signed engine.exe to the bundle:
    insignia -ab engine.exe "YourInstaller.exe" -o "YourInstaller.exe"
    sign "YourInstaller.exe" with your certificate

 

You will find the insignia.exe in the Wix Toolkit's bin folder.
